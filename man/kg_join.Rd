\title{Join two KGX graphs by their nodes and edges.}
\usage{
kg_join(graph1, graph2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph1}{A \code{tbl_kgx()} graph.}

\item{graph2}{A \code{tbl_kgx()} graph.}

\item{...}{Other parameters (not used)}
}
\value{
A \code{tbl_kgx()} graph
}
\description{
Given two KGX graphs, returns a new KGX graph that is the union of the two input graphs,
with any edges between nodes repeated for aother nodes with the same subject and object \code{id}.
The engine of the first graph is used for the new graph.
}
\details{
This function first computes new node and edge data, by taking the full natural join of
node and edge data from the two input graphs, and then keeping unique rows. Note that nodes with
the same \code{id} that differ in any shared column are effectively kept as separate, taken
to represent the same entity in different contexts. (However, a node with an additional property will be
merged with a node without that property, as defined by the natural join.) In these
cases, any edge that connects to one of these nodes is also valid for the other node, and so the
method repeats edges across nodes with the same \code{id}.
