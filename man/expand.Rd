\arguments{
\item{graph}{A query \code{tbl_kgx()} graph ot query with.}

\item{engine}{(Optional) An engine to use for fetching query graph edges. If not provided, the graph's most recent engine is used.}

\item{direction}{The direction of associations to fetch. Can be "in", "out", or "both". Default is "both".}

\item{predicates}{A vector of relationship predicates (nodes in g are subjects in the KG), indicating which edges to consider in the neighborhood. If NULL (default), all edges are considered.}

\item{categories}{A vector of node categories, indicating which nodes in the larger KG may be fetched. If NULL (default), all nodes in the larger KG are will be fetched.}

\item{transitive}{If TRUE, include transitive closure of the neighborhood. Default is FALSE. Useful in combination with predicates like \code{biolink:subclass_of}.}

\item{...}{Other parameters passed to methods.}

A \code{tbl_kgx()} graph
}
\description{
Given an optional KG engine (e.g. a \code{file_engine()},
\code{neo4j_engine()}, or \code{monarch_engine()}) and a query \code{tbl_kgx()} graph, fetches additional nodes and edges
from the KG, expanding the query graph according to specific criteria. If the first parameter is an engine, that
engine is used; if the first parameter is a query graph, the most recent engine associated with the graph is used.
