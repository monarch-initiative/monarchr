\title{Summarize neighborhood}
\usage{
summarize_neighborhood(
  graph,
  engine = NULL,
  direction = "both",
  summarize = "edges"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A query graph to summarize the surrounding neighborhood for}

\item{engine}{(Optional) An engine to use. If not provided, the graph's most recent engine is used.}

\item{direction}{The direction of edges to include in the neighborhood}

\item{summarize}{Whether to summarize edges or nodes (default "edges")}
}
\value{
A tbl_kgx graph
}
\description{
Summarizes the neighborhood of the nodes of a given graph. Specifically,
letting $N$ be the set of nodes in the given graph, this function retrieves
counts of relationship predicates (or node categories) of nodes connected to
$N$ but not in $N$. This can be useful to examine the scale and scope of a
graph's collective neighborhood in the larger KG.
}
\details{
Note that the number of relationships returned may be larger than the number
of nodes they connect to; use summarize = "edges" to see edge counts between
nodes of different categories, and summarize = "nodes" to see counts of connected
node categories.

Additionally, when using \code{summarize = "edges"}, the summary will include
edges that may already be present in the query graph.

It is also possible to specify the direction of edges to include in the
neighborhood, using the direction parameter. The default is "both", which
includes both incoming and outgoing edges.
