#' Join two KGX graphs by their nodes and edges.
#'
#' Given two KGX graphs, returns a new KGX graph that is the union of the two input graphs,
#' with any edges between nodes repeated for aother nodes with the same subject and object `id`.
#' The engine of the first graph is used for the new graph.
#'
#' This function first computes new node and edge data, by taking the full natural join of
#' node and edge data from the two input graphs, and then keeping unique rows. Note that nodes with
#' the same `id` that differ in any shared column are effectively kept as separate, taken
#' to represent the same entity in different contexts. (However, a node with an additional property will be
#' merged with a node without that property, as defined by the natural join.) In these
#' cases, any edge that connects to one of these nodes is also valid for the other node, and so the
#' method repeats edges across nodes with the same `id`.
